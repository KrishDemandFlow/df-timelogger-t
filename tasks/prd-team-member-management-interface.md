# Team Member Management Interface PRD

## Overview
This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive team member management interface for the Time Logger Tool. Currently, team member management requires direct access to the Supabase dashboard, which is not user-friendly for project managers and administrators. This interface will provide an intuitive web-based UI for adding, editing, and managing team member information, specifically focusing on ClickUp users who log time in the system.

## Problem Statement
- Project managers need technical access to Supabase dashboard to manage team members
- No validation or user-friendly error handling when adding/editing team member data
- Risk of data corruption from direct database manipulation
- Inefficient workflow disrupts team management tasks
- No audit trail for team member information changes
- Difficulty in onboarding new team members to the time tracking system
- No easy way to deactivate or remove team members who leave the organization

## Goals
1. **Eliminate Supabase dashboard dependency** - Project managers can manage team members entirely through the web interface
2. **Improve data integrity** - Implement proper validation and error handling
3. **Enhance user experience** - Provide intuitive forms with clear feedback
4. **Increase efficiency** - Streamline team member onboarding and maintenance workflows
5. **Enable self-service** - Reduce dependency on technical team members
6. **Ensure accurate time tracking** - Maintain proper ClickUp user integration for time logging
