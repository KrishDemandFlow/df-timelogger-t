# Client Management Interface PRD

## Overview
This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive client management interface for the Time Logger Tool. Currently, client management requires direct access to the Supabase dashboard, which is not user-friendly for project managers. This interface will provide an intuitive web-based UI for adding, editing, and managing client information.

## Problem Statement
- Project managers need technical access to Supabase dashboard to manage clients
- No validation or user-friendly error handling when adding/editing client data
- Risk of data corruption from direct database manipulation
- Inefficient workflow disrupts project management tasks
- No audit trail for client information changes

## Goals
1. **Eliminate Supabase dashboard dependency** - Project managers can manage clients entirely through the web interface
2. **Improve data integrity** - Implement proper validation and error handling
3. **Enhance user experience** - Provide intuitive forms with clear feedback
4. **Increase efficiency** - Streamline client onboarding and maintenance workflows
5. **Enable self-service** - Reduce dependency on technical team members

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Project Managers
- **As a project manager**, I want to add a new client so I can start tracking their retainer hours immediately
- **As a project manager**, I want to edit existing client details so I can update billing cycles or allocated hours
- **As a project manager**, I want to see all client information in one place so I can quickly review and manage accounts
- **As a project manager**, I want to validate ClickUp list IDs so I can ensure proper integration before saving
- **As a project manager**, I want to delete clients who are no longer active so I can maintain a clean client list

## Open Questions

1. **Bulk operations** - Should we support bulk client import/export?
2. **Client templates** - Should we provide templates for common client types?
3. **Approval workflow** - Should client changes require approval?
4. **Notification system** - Should we notify stakeholders of client changes?
5. **Historical tracking** - Should we maintain a history of client changes?

## Dependencies

- **Existing authentication system** - Must integrate with current auth
- **ClickUp API access** - Requires valid API token
- **Database permissions** - Proper RLS policies for client data
- **UI component library** - Consistent with existing design system

## Risks & Mitigations

### 1. ClickUp API Reliability
- **Risk**: API downtime affects client validation
- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback validation and retry logic

### 2. Data Migration
- **Risk**: Existing client data may not meet new validation rules
- **Mitigation**: Data cleanup script before deployment

### 3. User Adoption
- **Risk**: Users continue using Supabase dashboard
- **Mitigation**: Training sessions and gradual permission restrictions

### 4. Performance
- **Risk**: Large client lists impact performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and efficient queries
